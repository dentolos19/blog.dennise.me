# Introduction

`pnpm` is a package manager for Node.js that is designed to be faster and more efficient than `npm`. It achieves this by using a shared store of packages, which means that each package is only downloaded once and can be used by multiple projects. This reduces the amount of disk space used and speeds up installation times. Additionally, `pnpm` uses hard links instead of copying files, which further reduces disk usage and speeds up installation times. Overall, `pnpm` is a great choice for projects that require fast and efficient package management.

You can read more about this [here](https://pnpm.io/motivation).

# Instructions

1. Install `pnpm`, there are [various ways](https://pnpm.io/installation) of installing it.

2. Delete the `package-lock.json` file and `node_modules` folder, they will be replaced by files generated by `pnpm`.

3. In your `package.json` file, add this preinstall command `npx only-allow pnpm` under scripts. This will make sure that other devs will only be allowed to use `pnpm`.

```jsonc
{
  "name": "app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npx only-allow pnpm" // this is the line that you add
  }
}
```

4. Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies.

5. Done!

# What's next?

After having migrated to `pnpm`, you should replace anything replaced to `npm` with `pnpm` in your command line or your IDE. For example...

- `npm run dev` 游목 `pnpm run dev`
- `npm install sass` 游목 `pnpm install sass`
- `npm update --latest` 游목 `pnpm update --latest`
- `npx create-next-app` 游목 `pnpx create-next-app`

That's all! See you next time... 游녦
