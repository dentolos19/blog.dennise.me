Hello there! I am Dennise! ðŸ‘‹

I started programming since I was in primary school. I was so fascinated by the magic of computers that I wanted to learn how to make them do anything I imagined. I taught myself various languages and frameworks, and soon I was creating amazing apps and games. Programming is not just a hobby for me. It's fun, challenging, and rewarding but hard. I love solving problems and creating new things with code. I'm always eager to learn new skills and improve my craft. Programming is like life, having ups and downs.
